**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

_PROBLEM1_.
In this problem we have certain test cases which needs to get passed. For that to happen need to complete the src code.
In the resources folder/problem1 input files are present.

So as per problem statement we need to parse and calculate number of rows for different type of files.

This problem will test your skills in Design pattern (Factory). 
Apart from that use java principles like SOLID, DRY and other clean coding practices (refer clean code book).


_PROBLEM2_.
In this problem  webservices APIS doing CRUD operations on Employee are already present. Need to implement the service class which can 
help out in completing the functionality. Repository and DTO are also provided.

This problem will help in understanding how basic CRUD operations are implemented using spring-data-jpa and basic concept of spring boot.

To test this start your spring boot application and use postman (or any other rest apis tool) to hit the apis.
Please do attach the screenshots of postman while raising PR in test/resources/problem2outputscreenshot folder. Sample is already provided.
